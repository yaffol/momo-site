Maths is one of the richest, most exciting languages there is - a language of precision that allows you to be completely exact, but a language of puzzles and mad ideas too. 

Too often in schools, maths is taught by people who have fallen out of love, to students who don't see its beauty. What if there was a playground, showing maths' best side, so everyone could come and discover its charms?

That's my vision. For now the museum is virtual and touring. We build towards the physical.

My own background is more science than maths - I studied Biochemistry at Keble College Oxford, and then teacher training for middle years (KS2 and 3) at Homerton College Cambridge. But I quickly switched from Science to Maths and have been teaching that on and off for twenty years.
